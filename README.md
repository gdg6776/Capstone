These are the tools for studying how youtube is used to provide and seek support for suicide.
This project requires Python 2.7 and some data science libraries.
We have separate scripts for Development and testing.


To start the program simply run the schell script job.sh using following command -
 - "chmod u+x dev.sh" #This makes script runnable for you
 - "./dev.sh"
 - "chmod u+x test.sh" #This makes script runnable for you
 - "./test.sh"

This should give you the analysis of Youtube data.
